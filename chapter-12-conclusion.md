# Conclusion

If you have **read the entire** book and you've solved all the problems from the exercises and reached the present conclusion, **congratulations**! You've already made the **first step** in learning the **profession of a programmer**, but there is a **long way** to go until you become **really good** and make **software writing** your **profession**.

## Developer Skills

Remember the **[four main groups of skills](chapter-00-preface.md#become-a-developer)** that each programmer must have in order to work in the industry:
- Skill #1 – **writing the program code** (20% of programmer's skills) – covered to a large degree by this book, but you must learn additional basic data structures, classes, objects, functions, strings and other elements of code writing.
- Skill #2 – **algorithmic thinking** (30% of programmer's skills) – covered partially by this book and developed mostly by solving a large amount of diverse algorithmic problems.
- Skill #3 – **fundamental understanding of the profession** (25% of programmer's skills) – acquired for a few years in combination with learning and practice (reading books, watching video lessons, attending courses and mostly by writing diverse projects in various technological areas).
- Skill #4 – **programming languages and software technologies** (25% of programmer's skills) – acquired in a long period of time, by a lot of practice, consistent reading and writing projects. Such knowledge and skills quickly get outdated and need to be updated frequently. Good programmers are involved in studying new technologies every day.
## This Book is Only the First Step!

**The present** book on programming basics is just the **first step** in building the skills of a programmer. If you were able to solve **all problems**, this means you have **obtained valuable knowledge** in the programming principles with Java on a **basic level**. You are about to start **in-depth** studying of programming, and develop **your algorithmic thinking**, and then add **technological knowledge** regarding the Java language and the Java ecosystem (Java EE, Spring, Android, etc.), front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and many other concepts, technologies and instruments for software development.

If you were **not able** to solve all problems or a large part of them, go back and solve them! Remember that **becoming a programmer** requires **a lot of work and effort**. This profession is not for lazy people. There is no way to learn it, unless **you seriously practice** programming for years!

As we've already explained, the first and basic skill of a programmer is **to learn to write code** with ease and pleasure. This is namely the mission of this book: to teach you how to code. We recommend you, besides reading the book, to enroll in the **[practical course "Programming Basics" at SoftUni](https://softuni.org/apply)**, which is offered for free, in on-site or online format of training.

## How to Proceed After This Book?

This book **gives you solid grounds**, thanks to which it will be easy for you to continue developing as programmers. If you wonder how to continue your development, you have the following possibilities:
- to study for a **software engineer at SoftUni** and make programming your profession;
- to continue developing as a programmer **in your own way**, for example through self-training or via online lessons;
- to **stay at coder level**, without going more seriously into programming.

### Study Software Engineering in SoftUni

The first, and respectively recommended option to master fully and on high level the profession of a "software engineer", is to start your training via the **end-to-end SoftUni program for software engineers**: https://softuni.org. The SoftUni curriculum is carefully developed by **Dr. Svetlin Nakov and his team**, in order to provide you consequently and with gradually increasing complexity all the skills that a software engineer must have, in order **to start a career as a software developer** in an IT company.

#### Training Duration in SoftUni

The training in SoftUni has a duration of **1-2 years** (depending on the profession and the selected specializations) and during that period it is normal to reach a good starting level (junior developer), but this is **only if you study seriously** and write code intensely every day. Upon having good grades, a typical student **starts a job around the middle of the training (after around 1.5 years)**. Thanks to the well-developed partners network, **the career center of SoftUni offers work** in a software or IT company to all SoftUni students who have very good or excellent grades. **Starting a job** in the major in case of having good grades at SoftUni, combined with willingness to work and reasonable expectations towards the employers, is almost guaranteed.

#### It Takes at Least a Year of Intense Code Writing to Become a Programmer

Keep in mind that **to become a programmer takes a lot of efforts**, writing tens of thousands of lines of code, and solving hundreds, even thousands of practical problems, and this takes years! If someone offers you "**an easier program**" and promises you to become a programmer and start working within 3-4 months, then either they are **lying** to you, or they will give you such a low level, that **companies won't even take you as a trainee**, even if you pay to the company that is wasting its time with you. There are exceptions, of course, for example if you are not starting from scratch, or if you have extremely well-developed engineering thinking, or if you apply for a very low position (for example technical support), but in general, **you cannot become a programmer if you haven't spent at least 1 year of intense learning and code writing**!

#### The Entrance Exam in SoftUni

In order **to enroll at SoftUni** you need to attend an **entrance exam** in "Programming Basics" on the material from this book. If you easily solve the problems in this book, then you are ready for the exam. Also, pay attention to the chapters on **preparation for the practical exam in programming**. They will give you a good idea of the level of difficulty of the exam and the types of tasks that you need to learn solving.

If the tasks from the book and the preparation examples are hard for you, then you **need more preparation**. Enroll for the [free course in "Programming Basics"](https://softuni.org/apply) or go through the book carefully one more time, without skipping solving **the problems in any of the studied topics**! You must learn how **to solve them with ease**, without helping yourselves with the guidelines and the sample solutions.

#### The SoftUni Curriculum for Software Engineers

What follows after the entrance exam is a **serious curriculum** in the SoftUni program for training software engineers. It is formed as a sequence of **modules in a number of courses** in programming and software technologies, fully directed towards gaining fundamental knowledge in software development and acquiring **practical skills for working** as a programmer with the most contemporary software technologies. Students are given a choice between **a number of professions** and specializations focused on C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP and other languages and technologies. Each profession is trained in a number of modules with 4 months duration, and each module consists of 2 or 3 courses. The classes are divided into **theoretical preparation** (30%) and **practical exercises, projects and trainings** (70%), and each course ends with a practical exam or practical academic project.

#### How Many Hours per Day Does the Training Take?

The training for software engineers at SoftUni is a **very serious occupation** and you need to spend on it **at least 4-5 hours every day**, preferably your entire attention and time. Combining **working and training** is not always successful, but if your work is less demanding and you have a lot of spare time, it is a good opiton. SoftUni is an appropriate option for **school students**, **university students** and **people who work in another field**, but it is best if you assign your entire time to your training and mastering the profession. It will not work out if you spend 2 or 4 hours a week on it!

The forms of training at SoftUni are **on-site** (the better choice) and **online** (if you don't have another option). In both forms of training, in order to learn the program in the curriculum (that is required by software companies for starting a job), you need **a lot of learning**. You just need to **find the time for it**! Reason #1 for having hard time on the road to the profession in SoftUni is not spending enough time for the training: as a minimum you need to spend at least 20-30 hours a week.

#### SoftUni for People Who Work and Study

We recommend to everyone who gets **excellent score at the SoftUni entrance exam** and are really passionate about making programming their profession, to leave the rest of their commitments aside and **spend their entire time** on learning the profession of a "software engineer" and start making a living from it.

- For people who **work** this means quitting their job (and getting a loan or decreasing their expenses, in order to live with a lower income for a period of 1-2 years until they start working in the new profession).
- For people who **study** at a traditional university, this means to move significantly their focus towards programming and the practical courses in SoftUni, by decreasing the time spend in the traditional university.
- For **unemployed** people this is an excellent chance to assign their entire time, power and energy on acquiring a new, perspective, well paid and highly sought profession, that will give them good life quality and a long-term prosperity.
- For **students** in secondary schools and high-schools this means **giving a priority** to what is more important in their development: studying practical programming in SoftUni, that will give them a profession and a job, or giving their full attention to the traditional education system, or combining smartly both undertakings. Unfortunately, often priorities are determined by parents, and we don't have a solution for these cases.

We recommend to all who **cannot get an excellent score at the SoftUni entrance exam** to spend more time on better learning, understanding, and most of all, practicing the material studied in the present book. If you cannot easily solve the problems in this book, you will not be able to cope with programming and software development in the future. 

**Do not skip the programming basics!** Do not under any circumstances make bold decisions and quit your job or the traditional university, making great plans for your future profession of a software engineer, if you don't have an excellent grade at the SoftUni entrance exam! It measures if programming is suitable for you, to what extend you like it and if you are motivated to study it seriously, and work this for years every day with joy and pleasure.

### Study Software Engineering in Your Own Way

Another possibility to develop after this book is to **continue studying programming outside of SoftUni**. You can enroll or subscribe to **video trainings** that go into more details in programming with Java or other languages and development platforms. You can **read books** on programming and software technologies, follow **online tutorials** and other online resources – there are plenty of free materials on the Internet. However, keep in mind that the most important thing towards the profession of a programmer is **to do practical projects**!

**You cannot become a programmer without a lot of code writing and intense practicing**. Allocate **sufficient time** to it. You cannot become a programmer for a month or two. On the Internet you will find a wide variety of **free resources**, such as books, manuals, video lessons, online and on-site courses on programming and software development. However, you need to invest **at least a year or two** to acquire a foundation level, needed for starting a job.

After you gain some experience, find a way to start **an internship in a company** (which will be almost impossible unless you'd spent at least a year of intense code writing before that) or come up with **your own practical project**, on which you need to spend a few months, even a year, in order to learn based on the trial-and-error principle.

## Recommended Resources for Developers

A **huge amount of resources** is available on the Web for developers: online trainings, courses, tutorials, books, interactive training sites, etc.

We can not mention all of them, because they change over the time and because the list might be huge. What we recommend is to **join the developer communities** in your region, because this will help you a lot when you study.

### Online Communities for Beginners in Programming

Regardless of the path you have chosen, if you are seriously involved in programming, we recommend subscribing to specialized **online forums, discussion groups and communities**, from which you can get assistance by your colleagues and track the novelties in the software industry.

If you will study programming seriously, **surround yourselves with people who are involved in programming** seriously. Join **communities of software developers**, attend software conferences, go to events for programmers, find friends with whom you can talk about programming and discuss problems and bugs, find environment that can help you. In most large towns there are free events for programmers, a few times a week. In smaller localities you have the Internet and an access to the entire online community.

Here are some recommended **resources** that will be useful for your development as a programmer:
* https://softuni.org – official **website of SoftUni**. In it you will find free (and not only) courses, seminars, video tutorials and trainings in programming, software technologies and digital competences.
* https://www.facebook.com/softuni.org – official **Facebook page of SoftUni**. By it you will learn regarding new courses, seminars and events related to programming and software development.
