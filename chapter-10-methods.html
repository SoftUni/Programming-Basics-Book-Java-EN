<p>In this chapter, we will introduce you to <strong>methods</strong>. We will learn what they are, what is their <strong>base concepts</strong> when working with them. We will learn why it is a <strong>good practice</strong> to use them, how to <strong>declare</strong> and <strong>call</strong> them. We will also introduce you to the <strong>parameters</strong> and <strong>return value of a method</strong> and how to use that return value. At the end of this chapter, we will look at the <strong>established practices</strong> when using methods.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-method"><a name="what-is-method" class="plugin-anchor" href="#what-is-method"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>What is &quot;method&quot;?</h2>
<p>So far, we have found out that while <strong>writing</strong> a code for a program that solve a task, <strong>separating</strong> the task into different <strong>parts</strong> favors us a lot. Every part is responsible for a <strong>corresponding action</strong> and by doing so, it is <strong>easier</strong> to solve the task, and the <strong>readability</strong> and the debugging of the code are better.</p>
<p>A block of code designed to perform a particular task, which we have logically separated is called a <strong>method</strong>. <strong>Methods &#x2013; pieces of code, that are named</strong> by us in a certain way and could be called as many times as we need.</p>
<p>A <strong>method</strong> can be <strong>called</strong> as many times as we think we need to solve a problem. That <strong>saves</strong> us from repeating the same code several times, <strong>reduces</strong> the possibility of making a mistake while editing the repeated code.</p>
<h3 id="simple-methods"><a name="simple-methods" class="plugin-anchor" href="#simple-methods"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Simple methods</h3>
<p>Simple methods are responsible for running a specific <strong>action</strong> that will <strong>help</strong> us to solve a problem. Those actions can be printing a string on the console, performing some checks, performing a loop, etc.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s look at the following <strong>example of a simple method</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/01.Simple-method-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This <strong>method</strong> has the task to print a header containing a series of the symbol <strong><code>-</code></strong>. Because of this, the name of the method is <strong><code>printHeader</code></strong>. The parentheses <strong><code>(</code></strong> and <strong><code>)</code></strong> always follows the name, no matter how we have named the method. Later we will take a look at how we should name methods. For now, we will only say that the <strong>name of a method must describe the action</strong> he performs.</p>
<p>The <strong>body</strong> of the method consists of <strong>programming code</strong>, which is located between the curly brackets <strong><code>{</code></strong> and <strong><code>}</code></strong>. Between them, we place code, that will solve our problem, described by the name of the method.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-we-use-methods"><a name="why-should-we-use-methods" class="plugin-anchor" href="#why-should-we-use-methods"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Why should we use methods?</h3>
<p>Up to this moment, we have found out that, methods help us with <strong>separating big tasks into smaller parts</strong>, which leads to a <strong>simple solution</strong> of the corresponding problem. It makes our program, not just well structured, <strong>easy readable</strong> but also more understandable.</p>
<p>Using methods, we <strong>escape repeating</strong> of programming code. <strong>Repeating</strong> code is a bad practice, as it makes it very difficult to maintain the program and leads to errors. If one part of code exists in our program more than once and we have to fix it, we will have to change at every occurrence it. The probability of us forgetting one of the repeated places is high, which will lead to incorrect behavior of our program. It is why it&apos;s a <strong>good practice</strong> to define a fragment that will be used <strong>more than once</strong> as a <strong>separate method</strong>.</p>
<p>Methods offer us an <strong>opportunity</strong> to use <strong>code several times</strong>. With solving more and more tasks, we will conclude that using already defined methods saves us much time and effort.</p>
<h3 id="declaring-methods"><a name="declaring-methods" class="plugin-anchor" href="#declaring-methods"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Declaring methods</h3>
<p>In Java language, you can <strong>declare</strong> methods inside a class, i.e., between the opening <strong><code>{</code></strong> and closing <strong><code>}</code></strong> brackets of the classbut not in the declaration of another method. The declaration is the registration of the method in the program, and thus the method will be recognized in the rest of it. The best-known example is the <strong><code>main(&#x2026;)</code></strong> method, which we use in every program we write.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/02.Declaring-methods-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the next example, we will look at the mandatory elements in the declaration of a method.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/02.Declaring-methods-02.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The type of the returned value</strong>. In this case, the type is <strong><code>double</code></strong>, which means that the method will <strong>return a result</strong>, which is of <strong><code>double</code></strong> type. The returned value can be <strong><code>int</code></strong>, <strong><code>double</code></strong>, <strong><code>string</code></strong>, <strong>etc.</strong>, and also <strong><code>void</code></strong>. If the type is <strong><code>void</code></strong>, this means that the method <strong>doesn&apos;t return</strong> a result, but only <strong>does a particular operation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Method name</strong>. The name of the method is <strong>defined by us</strong>, but we should not forget that it has to <strong>describe the function</strong>, executed by the code in its body. In the example, the name is <strong><code>GetSquare</code></strong>, which tells us that this method calculates the area of a square.</li>
<li><strong>Parameters list</strong> is declared between the parentheses <strong><code>(</code></strong> and <strong><code>)</code></strong> that we write after its name. Here we list all the <strong>parameters</strong> that the method will use. There can be <strong>only one</strong> parameter, <strong>multiple</strong> ones, or it could be an <strong>empty</strong> list. If there are no parameters, we will write only the parentheses <strong><code>()</code></strong>. In this example, we declare one parameter with a name <strong><code>side</code></strong> and with a type <strong><code>double</code></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><code>static</code></strong> declaration in the method description. For the moment, we can accept that we write <strong><code>static</code></strong> always when we declare a method. Later, when we get familiar with object-oriented programming (OOP), we will learn about the difference between <strong>static methods</strong> (shared for the whole class) and <strong>methods of an object</strong>, which work on the data of a particular instance of the class (object).</li>
</ul>
<p>When declaring methods, you must follow the <strong>sequence</strong> of its base elements &#x2013; first is the <strong>keyword <code>static</code></strong> then the <strong>type of the returned value</strong>, then <strong>method name</strong>, and finally <strong>list of parameters</strong>, surrounded by parentheses <strong><code>()</code></strong>. </p>
<p>After we have declared a method, its <strong>implementation (body)</strong> follows. In the body of the method, we write down <strong>the algorithm</strong>, by which it solves a problem, i.e., the body contains the code (program block), which applies the method&apos;s <strong>logic</strong>. In the example above we calculate the area of a square, which is <strong><code>side * side</code></strong>. </p>
<p>When declaring a variable in the body of a method, it is called a <strong>local</strong> variable. The area where this variable exists and can be used starts from the line where we have declared it and reaches the closing curly bracket <code>}</code> of the body of the method. This area is called <strong>variable scope</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="calling-a-method"><a name="calling-a-method" class="plugin-anchor" href="#calling-a-method"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Calling a method</h3>
<p><strong>Calling</strong> a method means <strong>starting to execute the code</strong>, which is in <strong>the body of the method</strong>. It happens by writing its <strong>name</strong>, followed by parentheses <strong><code>()</code></strong> and the semicolon sign <strong><code>;</code></strong> to end the line. If the method needs input data, it is given in the parentheses <strong><code>()</code></strong>, and the succession of the parameters should be the same as one of the given parameters when declaring the method. Here is an example:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/03.Invoking-methods-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A method can be called from <strong>several places</strong> in the program. One way is to call it inside <strong>the main method</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/03.Invoking-methods-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A method can also be called from <strong>the body of another method</strong>, which is <strong>not</strong> the main method of the program.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/03.Invoking-methods-03.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A method can be called from <strong>its own body</strong>. It is called <strong>recursion</strong> and you can find more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> or google it.</p>
<p>It is important to know that if a method is declared in a class, it can be called before the line, on which it has been declared.</p>

<p>The first step is to create a <strong><code>void</code></strong> method to <strong>print the upper part</strong> of the receipt (header). Let&apos;s give it a meaningful name, which describes what the method does, e.g., <strong><code>PrintReceiptHeader</code></strong>. In its body, write the code from the example below:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/04.Print-receipt-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the same way, we&apos;ll create two more methods: one <strong>to print the middle part</strong> of the receipt (body) <strong><code>PrintReceiptBody</code></strong> and another <strong>to print the bottom part</strong> of the receipt (footer) <strong><code>PrintReceiptFooter</code></strong>.</p>
<p>After this we will create <strong>another method</strong>, which will call the three methods we already wrote, one after the other:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/04.Print-receipt-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, we&apos;ll <strong>call</strong> the <strong><code>PrintReceipt</code></strong> method from the body of the <strong><code>Main</code></strong> method of our program:</p>

<p>The program with a total of five methods that call one another is ready and we can <strong>run and debug it</strong>. After that, we will send it for test in the Judge system: <a href="https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#0" target="_blank">https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#0</a>.</p>
<h2 id="methods-with-parameters"><a name="methods-with-parameters" class="plugin-anchor" href="#methods-with-parameters"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Methods with parameters</h2>
<p>Often to solve a problem, the method by which we achieve this needs <strong>additional information</strong>, which depends on its purpose. This information represents the <strong>parameters of the method</strong> , and its behavior depends on them. </p>
<h3 id="using-parameters-in-methods"><a name="using-parameters-in-methods" class="plugin-anchor" href="#using-parameters-in-methods"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Using parameters in methods</h3>
<p>As we noted above, <strong>the parameters can be zero, one or more</strong>. When declaring them, you should divide them with a comma. They can be of any type (<strong><code>int</code></strong>, <strong><code>string</code></strong>, etc.), and below is an example of how they are used by the method.</p>
<p>We <strong>declare</strong> the method and its <strong>list</strong> of <strong>parameters</strong>, then we write the code that the method executes.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/05.Method-parameters-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After that <strong>call</strong> the method and <strong>give it particular values</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/05.Method-parameters-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When <strong>declaring parameters</strong>, we can use <strong>various</strong> types of variables, and we should be careful that every parameter has a <strong>type</strong> and <strong>name</strong>. It is important to note that when calling the method, we must pass to its <strong>values</strong> for the parameters in <strong>the order</strong>, in which they are <strong>declared</strong>. If the parameters are first <strong><code>int</code></strong> and after that <strong><code>string</code></strong>, when calling the method, we can&apos;t give it first a <strong><code>string</code></strong> and then <strong><code>int</code></strong>. </p>
<p>Let&apos;s look at the example for declaring a method, which has several parameters of different types.</p>

<p>The next step is <strong>implementing</strong> the logic by which the program will check what the sign of the number is.

<p>Before creating a method to print a row with a given beginning and an end, we must read the input number from the console. After that, we choose a meaningful name, which describes its purpose, e.g., <strong><code>printLine</code></strong>, and implements it.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/07.Print-triangle-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the drawing exercises, we remember that it is &#x430; good practice <strong>to divide the figure into several parts</strong>. To make it easier, we will divide the triangle into three parts &#x2013; upper, middle, and bottom.</p>
<p>The next step is to print <strong>the upper half</strong> of the triangle using a loop:</p>

<p>The first step is to read the input from the console. After that, we need to create a method, which will print the first and the last rows because they are the same.

<p>So far, we have looked at methods that do a specific task, for example, printing a text, number, or figure on the console. There is another type of method that can <strong>return</strong> a <strong>result</strong> from their task. We will look at this type of method in the following lines.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-returned-values"><a name="types-of-returned-values" class="plugin-anchor" href="#types-of-returned-values"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Types of returned values</h3>
<p>So far, we saw some examples, in which when declaring methods, we used the keyword <strong><code>void</code></strong>, which shows that the method <strong>does not</strong> return a result, but just executes a certain action.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/09.Return-types-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If we <strong>replace</strong> <strong><code>void</code></strong> with <strong>a type</strong> of some variable, this will tell the program that the method should return a value of the said type. This returned value could be of any type &#x2013; <strong><code>int</code></strong>, <strong><code>String</code></strong>, <strong><code>double</code></strong>, etc. </p>
<table><tr><td><img src="assets/alert-icon.png" style="max-width:50px">
</td><td>For a method to return <strong>a result</strong> we need to write the type of returned value we expect when declaring the method, in place of the <code>void</code>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/09.Return-types-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We should note that <strong>the result</strong> returned by the method can be of <strong>a type, compatible with the type of the returned value</strong> of the method. For example, if the declared type of the returned value is <strong><code>double</code></strong>, we can return a value of <strong><code>int</code></strong> type.</p>
<h3 id="the-return-operator"><a name="the-return-operator" class="plugin-anchor" href="#the-return-operator"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>The &quot;return&quot; operator</h3>
<p>To obtain a result from the method, we need to use the <strong><code>return</code></strong> operator. It should be <strong>used in the body</strong> of the method and tells the program to <strong>stop its execution</strong> and to <strong>return</strong> to the method&apos;s caller, a <strong>value</strong> that is defined by the expression after the <strong><code>return</code></strong> operator.</p>
<p>In the example below, there is a method that reads two names from the console, concatenates them, and returns them as a result. The return value is of <strong><code>String</code></strong> type:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/10.Return-operator-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <strong><code>return</code></strong> operator can also be used in <strong><code>void</code></strong> methods. This way, the method will stop its execution without returning a value, and after it, there shouldn&apos;t be an expression, which should be returned. In this case, we use <strong><code>return</code></strong> only to exit the method.</p>
<p><strong>There are cases</strong> where <strong><code>return</code></strong> can be called, from multiple places in the method, but only if there are <strong>certain</strong> input conditions.</p>
<p>We have a method in the example below, which compares two numbers and returns a result respectively <strong><code>-1</code></strong>, <strong><code>0</code></strong>, or <strong><code>1</code></strong> depending on if the first argument is less than, equals to, or greater than the second argument, given to the method. The method uses the keyword <strong><code>return</code></strong> in three different places, to return three different values according to the logic of comparing the numbers:</p>

<p>When the <strong>return</strong> operator is located inside a conditional statement such as <strong><code>if</code></strong>, after the statement in the same block, we must <strong>not</strong> have rows with code because IntelliJ IDEA will display a warning telling us that it had found an <strong>unreachable</strong> statement.</p>

<p>In many programming languages, the same methods can be declared in <strong>different variants</strong> with the <strong>same name and different parameters</strong>. It is known as &#x201C;<strong>method overloading</strong>&#x201D;. Now let&apos;s see how to write these overloaded methods.</p>
<h3 id="method-signature"><a name="method-signature" class="plugin-anchor" href="#method-signature"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Method signature</h3>
<p>In programming methods are <strong>identified</strong> through the elements of their declaration: <strong>name</strong> of the method + a list of its <strong>parameters</strong>. These two elements define its specification, the so-called &#x201C;<strong>method signature</strong>&#x201D;.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/13.Method-signature-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example, the method&apos;s signature is its name (<strong><code>print</code></strong>), together with its parameter (<strong><code>String text</code></strong>).</p>
<p>If our program holds several <strong>methods with the same name</strong>, but with <strong>different lists of parameters (signatures)</strong>, we can say that we use <strong>method overloading</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="overloading-methods"><a name="overloading-methods" class="plugin-anchor" href="#overloading-methods"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Overloading methods</h3>
<p>As we mentioned, if you use <strong>the same name for several methods with different signatures</strong>, this means that you are <strong>overloading a method</strong>. The code below shows how three different methods can use the same name but have different signatures and execute different actions.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/14.Method-overloading-01.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="signature-and-return-value-type"><a name="signature-and-return-value-type" class="plugin-anchor" href="#signature-and-return-value-type"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Signature and return value type</h3>
<p>It is important to say that <strong>the returned type as a result</strong> of the method <strong>is not a part of its signature</strong>. If the returned type was a part of the signature, then the compiler doesn&apos;t know which method exactly to call (there is ambiguity).</p>
<p>Let&apos;s look at the following <strong>example</strong>: we have two methods with different return types. Even though IntelliJ IDEA shows that there is an error, our compiler won&apos;t know which of the two methods to invoke because they are with the same name <strong><code>print()</code></strong>.</p>

<p>The input is two values of the same type. The values can be of <strong><code>int</code></strong>, <strong><code>char</code></strong>, or <strong><code>String</code></strong> type. Create a method <strong><code>getMax()</code></strong> that returns, as a result, the greater of the two values.</p>

<p>To complete our task, we need to create three methods with the same name and different signatures. First, we create a method, which will compare integers.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/15.Greater-of-two-values-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Following the logic of the previous method, we create another one with the same name, but this one will compare characters.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/15.Greater-of-two-values-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The next method we need to create will compare strings. The logic here is a bit different from the previous two methods because variables of <strong><code>String</code></strong> type cannot be compared with the operators <strong><code>&lt;</code></strong> and <strong><code>&gt;</code></strong>. We will use the method <strong><code>compareTo(&#x2026;)</code></strong>, which returns a numerical value: greater than 0 (the compared object is larger), less than 0 (the compared object is smaller), and 0 (the two objects are the same).</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/15.Greater-of-two-values-03.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The last step is to read the input data, use the appropriate variables, and invoke the method <strong><code>getMax()</code></strong> from the body of the <strong><code>main()</code></strong> method.</p>

Best practices when working with methods</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we will introduce you to some of the <strong>best practices</strong> when working with methods. They will be related to naming, organizing our code and its structure. </p>
<h3 id="naming-methods"><a name="naming-methods" class="plugin-anchor" href="#naming-methods"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Naming methods</h3>
<p>When we name a method, it&apos;s recommended to use <strong>logical name</strong>. This is good because every method must <strong>correspond</strong> to a specific part of our problem. We must take into consideration the <strong>task</strong> which the method will do. This is why it&apos;s a good practice <strong>for the name to describes the purpose of the method</strong>.</p>
<p>It is required for the name of the method to start with a <strong>small letter</strong> and to be a verb or a combination of a verb and a noun. Formatting the names must be done following <strong>Lower Camel Case</strong> convention - <strong>every word except the first to start with an upper letter</strong>. Round brackets  <strong><code>(</code></strong> and <strong><code>)</code></strong> are always after the name of the method.</p>
<p>Every method must do an independent task, and the name must describe its role.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of <strong>correctly</strong> named methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>findStudent</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>loadReport</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>sine</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of <strong>badly</strong> named methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Method1</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>DoSomething</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>HandleStuff</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>SampleMethod</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>DirtyHack</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If we can&apos;t come up with a good name, it&apos;s probably because our method does more than one job or it doesn&apos;t have a clear task. We must think of a way to divide the method into several separate methods.</p>
<h3 id="naming-parameters-of-methods"><a name="naming-parameters-of-methods" class="plugin-anchor" href="#naming-parameters-of-methods"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Naming parameters of methods</h3>
<p>When naming <strong>the parameters</strong> of a method you can apply almost the same rules as with the methods themselves. The difference here is that it is good for the names of the parameters to use a noun or a couple of an adjective and a noun, and when naming the parameters, we use the <strong><code>lowerCamelCase</code></strong> convention, i.e., <strong>each word except for the first one starts with uppercase</strong>. We should note that it is a good practice that the name of the parameter <strong>shows</strong> what <strong>unit</strong> is used when working with it.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of <strong>correctly</strong> named parameters of methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>firstName</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>report</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>speedKmH</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>usersList</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>fontSizeInPixels</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>font</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of <strong>incorrectly</strong> named parameters: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>p</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>p1</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>p2</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>populate</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>LastName</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>last_name</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="good-practices-when-working-with-methods"><a name="good-practices-when-working-with-methods" class="plugin-anchor" href="#good-practices-when-working-with-methods"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Good practices when working with methods</h3>
<p>We must keep in mind that a method must do <strong>only one</strong> specific <strong>task</strong>. If this can&apos;t be achieved, then we must come up with a way to <strong>divide</strong> the functionality into different parts.
As we have already said, the name must be clear and descriptive. Another <strong>good practice</strong> is to <strong>avoid</strong> methods that are longer than our screen. If this happens, it&apos;s recommended to <strong>split</strong> the method into smaller ones, as shown in the example below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/04.Print-receipt-02.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="structure-and-formatting-of-the-code"><a name="structure-and-formatting-of-the-code" class="plugin-anchor" href="#structure-and-formatting-of-the-code"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Structure and formatting of the code</h3>
<p>When writing methods, we must keep in mind to follow a correct <strong>indentation</strong> (offset blocks of code).</p>
<p>Here are some examples of <strong>correctly</strong> formatted Java code:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/16.Good-practice-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Some examples of <strong>incorrectly</strong> formatted Java code:</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/16.Good-practice-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When the headline row of the method is <strong>too long</strong>, it&apos;s recommended to divide it into several rows, moving each row after the first one with two  tabs to the right (for better readability):</p>
<p><img src="assets/chapter-10-images/05.Method-parameters-03.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Another good practice is to <strong>leave an empty row</strong> between methods, after loops, and conditional statements. You should <strong>avoid</strong> writing <strong>long rows and complicated expressions</strong>. Over time you will find out that improves the readability and saves time.</p>
<p>We recommend you to always <strong>use curly brackets for the body of conditional statements and loops</strong>. The brackets don&apos;t just improve the readability but also reduce the possibility of making a mistake.</p>

<li>We got acquainted with the <strong>structure</strong> of methods and how to <strong>declare</strong> and <strong>call</strong> them by their name.</li>
<li>We looked into different examples of methods with <strong>parameters</strong> and how to use them in our program.</li>
<li>We learned what the <strong>signature</strong> and the <strong>return value</strong> of the method are and what the role of the <strong><code>return</code></strong> operator is in the methods.</li>

<p>To do the algorithm, use a <strong><code>while</code></strong> loop, until the given number equals 0. At each iteration of the <strong><code>while</code></strong> loop, check if the current index of the digit is equal to the index you are looking for. If it is, return as a result of the digit at this index (<strong><code>number % 10</code></strong>). If not, remove the last digit in the number (<strong><code>number = number / 10</code></strong>).

<p>We can first print <strong>the hundreds</strong> as a text - (the number / 100) % 10, after that <strong>the tens</strong> &#x2013;  (the number / 10) % 10 and at the end <strong>the ones</strong> &#x2013; (the number % 10).</p>
<p>The first special case is when the number is exactly <strong>rounded to 100</strong> (e.g. 101, 305, 609, etc.). In this case we print &quot;one-hundred&quot;, &quot;two-hundred&quot;, &quot;three-hundred&quot; etc.</p>
<p>The second special case is when the number formed by the last two digits of the input number is <strong>less than 10</strong>  (e.g. 101, 305, 609, etc.). In this case, we print &quot;one-hundred and one&quot;, &quot;three-hundred and five&quot;, &quot;six-hundred and nine&quot; etc.</p>
<p>The third special case is when the number formed by the last two digits of the input number is <strong>greater than 10 and less than 20</strong> (e.g. 111, 814, 919, etc.). In this case, we print &quot;one-hundred and eleven&quot;, &quot;eight-hundred and fourteen&quot;, &quot;nine-hundred and nineteen&quot; etc.</p>

<h3 id="task-string-encryption"><a name="task-string-encryption" class="plugin-anchor" href="#task-string-encryption"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Task: String encryption</h3>
<p>Write a method <strong><code>encrypt(char letter)</code></strong>, which encrypts a given letter in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes the first and the last digit from the ASCII code of the letter and concatenates them into a string, which will represent the result. </li>
<li>At the beginning of the string, which represents the result, we will insert the symbol which matches the following condition:<ul>
<li>ASCII code of the letter + the last digit of the ASCII code of the letter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After that, at the end of the string, which represents the result, you concatenate the character which matches the following condition:<ul>
<li>ASCII code of the letter - the first digit of the ASCII code of the letter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The method should return the encrypted string.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>j &#x2192; <strong>p16i</strong><ul>
<li>ASCII code of <strong>j</strong> is <strong>106</strong> &#x2192; First digit &#x2013; <strong>1</strong>, last digit &#x2013; <strong>6</strong>.</li>
<li>We concatenate the first and the last digit &#x2192; <strong>16</strong>.</li>
<li>At <strong>the beginning</strong> of the string, which represents the result, concatenate the symbol, which you get from the sum of the ASCII code + the last digit &#x2192; 106 + 6 &#x2192; 112 &#x2192; <strong>p</strong>.</li>
<li>At <strong>the end</strong> of the string, which represents the result, concatenate the symbol, which you get from subtracting the ASCII code &#x2013; the first digit &#x2192; 106 - 1 &#x2192; 105 &#x2192; <strong>i</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the method shown above, write a program that takes <strong>a sequence of characters</strong>, <strong>encrypts them</strong>, and prints the result on one line.</p>
<p>The input data will always be valid. The Main method must read the data given by the user &#x2013; an integer <strong><code>n</code></strong>, followed by a character for each of the following <strong><code>n</code></strong> lines.</p>
<p>Encrypt the symbols and add them to the encrypted string. In the end, as a result, you must print <strong>an encrypted string</strong> as in the following example.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>S, o, f, t, U, n, i &#x2192; V83Kp11nh12ez16sZ85Mn10mn15h</li>

<p>Our variable from type <strong><code>String</code></strong>, which will store the value of the result, will have an initial value of <strong><code>String str = &quot;&quot;</code></strong> (Empty String). The loop should iterate <strong><code>n</code></strong> times, and in every iteration, we will add to our variable the encrypted symbol.</p>
<p>To find the first and the last digit from the ASCII code, we will use the algorithm that we have used when solving the &quot;Integer to Base&quot; task.</p>
